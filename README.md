# Made In CHA

From tech startups to traditional manufacturing, Chattanooga is the birthplace to some of the country's most interesting and creative products. MadeInCHA.com is a collection (and celebration) of those products and the great, local companies that make them.

I would love to feature your most well known product on our site. To accomplish this, I need some information from you. Below I have outlined what is needed - a few things for the homepage of the site and a few additional things on a page that will be specific to your company and product. 

>Homepage: Product Photo - [Example](http://traivan98.xyz/Drop/index.html)
>* Company Name
>* Product Name
>* Product Image
>* 240px wide & 180 tall

With regards to the company-specific page, you will have two options. Please choose one and provide the appropriate content. 

>Option A: Single Image - [Example](http://traivan98.xyz/Drop/single-portfolio.html)
>* 1 Product Image
>  * 1240px wide & 1007px tall
>* About The Company
>  * ~100 words 

>Option B: Parallax - [Example](http://traivan98.xyz/Drop/parallax-portfolio.html)
>* 3 Product Images
>  * each 1500px wide and 1000px tall
>* About The Company
>  * ~100 words 

Additionally, please consider adding the following icon to your website. I believe that creating awareness for this collection is essential to its celebration.
